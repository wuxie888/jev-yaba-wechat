"""Floating HUD: a non-activating panel beside WeChat showing intent, risk and ranked replies.

Design notes
  * NSWindowStyleMaskNonactivatingPanel + floating level: the panel never steals focus
    from WeChat, and window-ID capture means it never appears in our own screenshots.
  * Poll loop: read the chat, hash the newest message, judge only when it changes.
  * The moment a new message is SEEN, both halves start (local pre-judge and the paid
    generation run concurrently, latest-wins); the settle gate then spends the finished
    verdict, waits out whatever generation is still missing, and only the local ranking
    (~0.5 s) is left after it. Candidates display before ranking finishes ("排序中")
    and are re-ordered in place when it lands.
  * The panel positions itself against WeChat's window each tick, so it follows moves,
    resizes and monitor changes without any window-server hooks.
  * Palette is WeChat's light theme (see PALETTE below); the Appearance is pinned to Aqua
    so the title bar and button bezels stay light even when the system is in dark mode.
  * 「填入」 writes through the Accessibility API into WeChat's input box (src/fill.py): no
    synthetic keystrokes, no clipboard, and nothing needs to be frontmost. It needs the
    Accessibility permission; when that is missing the HUD asks for it and reports the
    failure.

        speaker, which in a group chat throws away the most useful clue available: who is
        talking, and whether the last thing said was mine. One-to-one chats render no name
        above the bubble, so 我/对方 stands in.

        The halves take different depths: generation needs the conversational thread
        (CONTEXT_TURNS), while the judge's prompt is paid per forward — two turns carry
        most of the signal at roughly half the added prefill (JUDGE_TURNS).

        The message under judgment is excluded **by identity**, not by position: `newest` is
        the last message from the other side, which is not the same as the last element of
        `msgs` (my own replies come after it).
